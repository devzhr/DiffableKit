```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate `SPDiffable` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "ivanvorobei/SPDiffable"
```

### Manually
